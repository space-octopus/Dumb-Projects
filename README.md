# Dumb-Projects
I will not create folders because I'm too lazy and refuse to learn this website and want to waste more time making other stupid shitty programs.
But either way this repository is for the dumb shit that I make. Most of these programs will be harmful to your computer so I recommend running them in a VM.

#Trash.py
For this program you need RMS.jpg and Trash.py for it to work properly. Compile it yourself you lazy asshole.

#Hello Goodbye.py
You just need this and compile it yourself. Unless your using GNU/Linux where your in luck.

#InstallingGentoo.c++
This is just a program (virus) that I am working on so its not going to work.
